5. ABOUT ANTIVIRUS AND COMPRESSED BINARIES
================================================================================

This release's binary is packed with an executable/dll compression tool to
reduce his size (for an easy and quick upload/download).

Unfortunatly, some of these compression programs have a bad reputation in the
security software industry, mainly because almost 99% of troyans/worms/etc.
is packed with similar tools (or variants of these), and this self-unpack
behavior is taken by some antivirus apps as an alarm signal.

Basically, this means that any trusted program packed with one of these tools
can be erroneously detected as a virus, something know as a "FAKE POSITIVE".

********************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: If you got this release from me, from the site indicated at the end
of this document or from any file server explicitly expressed by me; ignore any
warning from your antivirus software (most certainly it's a fake positive).

IF YOU GOT THIS FROM ELSEWHERE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT YOUR COPY WILL BE FREE
OF ANY THREAT; IN THAT CASE, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGED CAUSED
TO YOUR COMPUTER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
********************************************************************************

However, you can always do a simple integrity check: get the MD5 or SHA1 hash
value for this release's binary and compare it against the value written at the
top of this document. Any difference between the hash values means that the
executable file was somehow modified/tampered. It's very simple.

There are plenty of free tools around the net that you can use to verify file
hashes, like HashTab (http://implbits.com) or HashMyFiles
(http://www.nirsoft.net). This test isn't a foolproof concept, but can help.
